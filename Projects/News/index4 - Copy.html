    "description": "Gujarat: NRI teen in Saudi Arabia raises funds for blind school in native place",
    "content": "VADODARA: Moved by a visit to a residential blind school in her native town Amreli, a Gujarati girl has started a campaign in Saudi Arabia to raise funds to install a solar power system at the institute.Megha Varma, a class 12 student at Jubail, the industrial city of Saudi Arabia, has set a target of raising Rs 10 lakh for the Andhjan Talim Kendra in Amreli.Seventeen-year-old Megha had visited Mrs Pushpavati Pranjivandas Valiya Andhjan Talim Kendra (training centre for the blind) at Amreli during her Diwali vacation last year with her father Nilesh Varma.The institute provides training to adult blind men by equipping them with skill sets like braille, music, computer, moulding, bookbinding, and motor rewinding among others along with higher secondary education facilities.But after talking to trustees and the principal, Megha realised that the school's operational expenses were under pressure due to low interest rates, high inflation and after effects of Covid-19 pandemic.\"One of their major expenses is financing electricity. The wish to permanently sort out their electricity bills has driven me to carry out this campaign,\" said Megha, who has already raised Rs 4 lakh through online campaigns and inviting Indian diaspora in Saudi Arabia to contribute to the social cause.Megha, who plans to pursue bioengineering or biomedical engineering next year from any reputed institute in US, Canada or Australia, is also taking help of social media to raise funds for the school.Currently, in Vadodara with her father, a former IPCL and L&T employee, Megha will be meeting some prominent businessmen and traders in Surat, who like her are also natives of Amreli.\"We are hoping to raise the remaining funds this year so that the solar power system is installed by end of this year,\" said Nilesh Varma, who studied chemical engineering from DDIT Nadiad. Speaking about Megha's initiative, the trustee of the residential school Sanjay Gandhi said, \"Our school was established on September 10, 1972 with the consent of Gujarat 's first chief minister Dr Jivraj Mehta. Since, then, we have been training 75-odd blind people annually. They are provided boarding and all other facilities free of cost.\"\"It is very heartening how Megha has started the campaign to raise funds for our school. We get government grants but often there is a gap in the grants we receive and the expenses we incur. If a solar power system is installed, we can save nearly Rs 20,000-25,000 every month which in turn can bridge the gap and help us meet other requirements,\" said Gandhi who is based in Mumbai.",

    "content": "Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia says OPEC+ may cuts production\n\nOPEC stands ready to cut output to correct a recent oil price decline driven by poor futures market liquidity and macro-economic fears, which has ignored extremely tight physical crude supply, OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia said on Monday.\n\nSaudi state news agency SPA cited Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as telling Bloomberg OPEC+ has the means and flexibility to deal with challenges.\n\nOn concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy and a possible recession in the West, oil prices have fallen in recent weeks from as high as $120 per barrel to about $95 per barrel.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine and the West retaliated by imposing harsh sanctions on Moscow, prices surged earlier this year to just below an all-time high of $147 per barrel, sparking concerns about the greatest energy supply crisis since the 1970s.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz was quoted as saying the oil futures market has fallen into \"a self-perpetuating vicious circle of very thin liquidity and extreme volatility\", making the cost of hedging and managing risks for market participants prohibitive.\n\nHe also was quoted as saying prices were falling based on \"unsubstantiated\" information about demand destruction and confusion around sanctions, embargoes and price caps, which have been proposed by the United States on Russian oil.\n\nAccording to Prince Abdulaziz, a new agreement between OPEC+ partners beyond 2022 would be beneficial. However, risks of supply disruptions held true and a global spare capacity cushion was extremely low.\n\n\"Soon we will start working on a new agreement beyond 2022,\" he said, without giving details.\n\nBrent crude prices pared losses on the news and were trading down 1.4% at $95.40 by 1720 GMT, having earlier slipped to as low as $92.36.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, agreed to increase output by 648,000 bpd in each of July and August as they fully unwind nearly 10 million bpd of cuts implemented in May 2020 to counter the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe group agreed earlier this month to raise production quotas by another 100,000 bpd in September as it faced pressure from major consumers including the United States which are keen to cool prices.\n\nOnly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are believed to have spare capacity and the ability to increase production in a meaningful way.\n\nBut Prince Abdulaziz pointed to thin liquidity and extreme volatility taking focus away from the issue of spare capacity.\n\n\"Without sufficient liquidity, markets can’t reflect the realities of the physical fundamentals in a meaningful way and can give a false sense of security at times when spare capacity is severely limited and the risk of severe disruptions remains high,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia says OPEC+ may cuts production\n\n OPEC stands ready to cut output to correct a recent oil price decline driven by poor futures market liquidity and macro-economic fears, which has ignored extremely tight physical crude supply, OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia said on Monday. \n\nHe also was quoted as saying prices were falling based on \"unsubstantiated\" information about demand destruction and confusion around sanctions, embargoes and price caps, which have been proposed by the United States on Russian oil. \n\nOnly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are believed to have spare capacity and the ability to increase production in a meaningful way.",
